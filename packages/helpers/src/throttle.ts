/**
 * Creates a throttled function that only invokes the provided function at most once
 * per every `throttleMs` milliseconds. Subsequent calls to the throttled function
 * within the wait time will not trigger the execution of the original function.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const throttledFunction = throttle(() => {
 *   console.log('Function executed');
 * }, 1000);
 *
 * // Will log 'Function executed' immediately
 * throttledFunction();
 *
 * // Will not log anything as it is within the throttle time
 * throttledFunction();
 *
 * // After 1 second
 * setTimeout(() => {
 *   throttledFunction(); // Will log 'Function executed'
 * }, 1000);
 * ```
 *
 * @param func - The function to throttle.
 * @param throttleMs - The number of milliseconds to throttle executions to.
 * @returns A new throttled function that accepts the same parameters as the original function.

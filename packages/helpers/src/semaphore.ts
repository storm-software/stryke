/**
 * A counting semaphore for async functions that manages available permits.
 * Semaphores are mainly used to limit the number of concurrent async tasks.
 *
 * Each `acquire` operation takes a permit or waits until one is available.
 * Each `release` operation adds a permit, potentially allowing a waiting task to proceed.
 *
 * The semaphore ensures fairness by maintaining a FIFO (First In, First Out) order for acquirers.
 *
 * @example
 * const sema = new Semaphore(2);
 *
 * async function task() {
 *   await sema.acquire();
 *   try {
 *     // This code can only be executed by two tasks at the same time
 *   } finally {
 *     sema.release();
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * task();
 * task();
 * task(); // This task will wait until one of the previous tasks releases the semaphore.

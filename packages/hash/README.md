## Reduced Package Size

This project uses [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to package the source code
due to its ability to remove unused code and ship smaller javascript files
thanks to code splitting. This helps to greatly reduce the size of the package
and to make it easier to use in other projects.
